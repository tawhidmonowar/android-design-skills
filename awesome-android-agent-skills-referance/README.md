Welcome to **Awesome Android Agent Skills**, a repository of specialized "brains" for your AI coding assistants. This project provides a suite of **Agent Skills** designed to supercharge GitHub Copilot, Claude, Google Gemini, Cursor and other agentic AI tools with expert knowledge of modern Android development.

##  What are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills** are a standardized way to package capabilities, instructions, and best practices for AI agents. Instead of pasting the same prompt repeatedly ("How do I implement MVVM?", "Check this for accessibility"), you install these skills into your agent's environment.

When an agent detects you are working on a relevant task (e.g., "Create a verified repository"), it automatically loads the expert instructions from the corresponding `SKILL.md` file. This ensures:
*   **Consistency**: The agent always follows your defined architecture.
*   **Accuracy**: It uses the latest 2025 best practices (Compose, Hilt, Room).
*   **Efficiency**: No need for long context-stuffing prompts.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `Agent.md` file is the foundation — every AI agent interacting with your project reads it implicitly to understand your project's architecture, minimum SDK, and testing philosophy before executing any specific tasks.

## Setup in Your Project

To equip your AI agent with these skills, you must place them in a location where the agent can discover them.

### Standard Location (VS Code / GitHub Copilot)
The industry standard location for agent skills is the `.github/skills/` directory at the root of your workspace.

1.  **Copy Skills**: Copy the `.github/skills/` folder from this repository to your project's root.
2.  **Copy Context**: Copy the `Agent.md` file from this repository to your project's root. This file ensures the agent always abides by your architecture and testing standards.
3.  **Verify**: Ensure your project structure looks like this:
    ```text
    my-android-project/
    ├── Agent.md
    ├── .github/
    │   └── skills/
    │       ├── architecture/
    │       │   ├── android-architecture/
    │       │   │   └── SKILL.md
    │       │   └── ...
    ├── app/
    └── ...
    ```
3.  **Restart**: specific extensions (like Copilot) may need a window reload to index the new skills.

### Other Environments

*   **Claude / Anthropic**: Legacy or direct Claude usage often looks for `.claude/skills/`. You can copy or symlink `.github/skills` to `.claude/skills`.
*   **OpenCode**: Supports `.opencode/skill/` (note singular `skill`) and `.claude/skills/`. Global skills can be placed in `~/.config/opencode/skill/`.

### Creating Custom Skills
To add your own skill:
1.  Create a new folder in `.github/skills/` (e.g., `my-custom-skill`).
2.  Add a `SKILL.md` file with the required frontmatter:
    ```markdown
    ---
    name: my-custom-skill
    description: Description of what this skill does
    ---
    # Instructions
    ...
    ```
## Usage

### GitHub Copilot
If this repository is part of your workspace, you can simply ask Copilot:
> "How should I structure the new User Profile feature?"
> "Create a repository for fetching News with offline support."

Copilot will detect the relevant skill (e.g., `android-architecture` or `android-data-layer`) and apply the rules defined in the `SKILL.md` files.

### Manual / Other Agents
You can also point any context-aware LLM (like ChatGPT or Claude) to the specific `SKILL.md` file you need help with.
> "Read `.github/skills/compose-ui/SKILL.md` and then refactor this screen."
